# TASK 1: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter the base and height of a triangle and returns its area.
# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.

# TASK 2: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Prompt the user for a number either on a form input or the terminal. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, display  either “odd” or “even” to the user.
#  Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.
# Extras:
# If the number is a multiple of 4, print out “divisible by 4”.

# TASK 3: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program which gets a phone number from a form input or terminal. Validates the phone number by checking if it starts with +254.. or 07.. or 7… or 254.. or 01... or  1.. Convert the number to start with +254… 
# e.g if a user enters “0712345678”, the program should display “+254712345678”
# e.g if a user enters “0112345678”, the program should display “+254112345678”
# e.g if a user enters “712345678”, the program should display “+254712345678”

# TASK 4: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program which accepts email as form input or from terminal. Validate the email by checking if it's a valid email. 
# Hint: Check if it contains an “@” symbol and “.” symbol.

# TASK 5: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Implement a program that takes 3 users  inputs from the terminal or the Browser, and stores them in three variables. Return the largest of the three. Do this without using the the inbuilt max () function!
# The goal of this exercise is to think about some internals that programs normally take care of for us. 

# TASK 6:Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program that lets the user input a password. Give them only 4 attempts to check the passwords entered against “admin@123”. If the password is correct access is granted. After you show them a message , the account is blocked.

# TASK 7: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100.Then output the correct grade: 
# A > 79 , B - 60 to 79, C  > 49 to 59, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40

# TASK 8: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
# For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.
# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.


# TASK 9: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program called stars. It should prompt the user for a number, and it should print the number of stars till the number entered.
# Example If rows is 5, it should print the following:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****.....

# TASK 10: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program that calculates the total stock in a company from the array/list below if we know that the stock is the last digit in every array/list.

# prods = [[‘omo’,’30kshs’,’300’], [‘milk’,’50kshs’,’200’],[‘bread’,’45kshs’,’359’], [‘coffee’,’5kshs’,’79’]]

# NB: ONCE YOU COPY AND PASTE THE LIST ABOVE,REWRITE THE SINGLE QUOTES AS THE ABOVE LIST WILL GIVE YOU AN ERROR.
# Once you learn functions,revisit this and write this code inside a function.

# TASK 11: Using Python or PHP or Java or Ruby or JavaScript
# Write a program that takes the date of birth of a person and the program outputs the age in terms of years,months,days TODAY.datetime
